# PARENT ACTIVITY - ðŸ§‘

The PARENT ACTIVITY is the implementation of a BINARY DECISION TREE that reads a file with the number of diseases, then the number of symptoms. After that, it stores all disease names in a string array and interprets the sequence of 0 or 1 (NO/YES) that corresponds to the symptoms the patient has or not. Upon reaching the final leaf, it prints the diagnosis.

## HOW TO EXECUTE THE PARENT ACTIVITY - ðŸš€
### STEP 1 -

- DOWNLOAD ALL SOURCE CODES AND LIBRARIES, ALSO DOWNLOAD THE .TXT FILES.
- ORGANIZE THEM IN A FOLDER AND OPEN IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN RUN C++ CODE.
### STEP 2 -

- NOW, MAKE SURE THE FILE WITH SYMPTOMS AND DISEASES IS INSIDE THE FOLDER AND ITS NAME IS CORRECTLY ENTERED
  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TREE CONSTRUCTOR CODE.
- OPEN THE TERMINAL AND COMPILE ALL SOURCE CODES AND LIBRARIES.
  USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE: "g++ main.cpp binarytree.cpp binarytree.h binarytree.h node.h node.cpp -o exe".
