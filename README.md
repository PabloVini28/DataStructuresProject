## Remarks: 📝
- Both assignments were developed during the Data Structures course, 2nd semester of Computer Engineering, at UFC Campus de Quixadá!

- Throughout the course, various common data structures in programming were covered such as Sequential Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, and Binary Trees.

- The Parent Activity covers manipulation of Sequential Lists, and the Child Activity involves manipulation of a Binary Decision Tree!
