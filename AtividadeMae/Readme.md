# PARENT ACTIVITY ðŸ‘©

The PARENT ACTIVITY involves manipulation of a SEQUENTIAL LIST INSIDE AN ARRAY, a kind of "LIST WITHIN ANOTHER LIST". It addresses the use of two attributes representing the HEAD and the TAIL of the list. With this, it is possible to make changes that allow for a lower computational cost than in a conventional sequential list. Furthermore, the implemented logic concerns the filling of the list inside the array. If one of the ends (LEFT/RIGHT) becomes full, a resizing (SHIFT) is performed, always manipulating the HEAD and the TAIL to ensure complete filling.

## HOW TO EXECUTE THE PARENT ACTIVITY - ðŸš€
### STEP 1 -

- DOWNLOAD ALL SOURCE CODES AND LIBRARIES.
- ORGANIZE THEM IN A FOLDER AND OPEN IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN RUN C++ CODE.
### STEP 2 -

- OPEN THE TERMINAL AND COMPILE ALL SOURCE CODES AND LIBRARIES.
- USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE: "g++ main.cpp doublevector.cpp doublevector.h -o exe".
